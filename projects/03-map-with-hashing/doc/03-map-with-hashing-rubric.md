| Students should be able to write a kernel class for a new type and its kernel operations (Map layered on an array of Maps, using hashing) | Correctness    | 3      | (0) No evidence of an attempt to write a kernel class          | (1) An attempt is made to write a kernel class, but there are several major bugs                    | (2) A kernel class is written, but there are some minor bugs           | (3) A correct kernel class is written with a special attention to details such as adhering to the correspondence                                                                                                                                       |
| Students should be able to develop and use specification-based test plans                                                                 | Testing        | 5      | (0) No testing plan is provided                                | (2) An attempt to create a testing plan is made but misses several important test cases             | (4) A thorough testing plan is created but misses a few key edge cases | (5) A complete test case is made that mirrors the design pattern discussed in class (see QueueOnSequence for an example of our expectations)                                                                                                           |
| Students should be able to follow the software sequence best practices (within reason)                                                    | Best Practices | 2      | (0) No evidence of software sequence best practices being used | (.5) An attempt to follow software sequence best practices is made, but there are some major errors | (1.5) Software sequence best practices are followed with minor errors  | (2) Software sequence best practices are properly followed (e.g., code includes helpful comments, checkstyle and findbugs warnings are missing, and project is submitted correctly)—see project checklist, if provided, for best practices to consider |
